      Steve Harrington is a fictional character from the Netflix television show

      character as the show has progressed, a development that has received
      widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike and has led to him becoming
      one of the showâ€™s most beloved and enduring characters.[1] Initially a
      part of the recurring cast, Keery was promoted to the main cast in the
      second season. Steve is a side antagonist turned protagonist at the end of
      season 1, and one of the main protagonists of season 2, season 3, and
      season 4.

    <h2>Fictional Character Biography</h2>

    <h3>Season 1</h3>
    <p>
      Steve is initially portrayed as a stereotypical 1980s popular jock,
      antagonistic and unlikable. Steve had been dating Nancy Wheeler but after
      he harasses Jonathan Byers by breaking his camera, Nancy seems to become
      close to Jonathan. Steve accosts Jonathan, but Jonathan beats him in a
      fight and Steve sees the error of his ways and ignores his former
      "friends". Traveling to the Byers' home to apologize, he becomes involved
      in Nancy and Jonathan's fight against the Demogorgon, which they defeat.
      At the conclusion of the season, Nancy buys Jonathan a new camera and
      Steve continues his relationship with Nancy.

    <h3>Season 2</h3>
    <p>
      Steve's relationship with Nancy is stressed, and he breaks up with her
      after she will not say she loves him. He calls her out after her drunken
      tirade at a party where she calls their relationship fake. Steve also
      finds himself at odds with Billy Hargrove, a new student at the school who
      seeks to become its tough guy. Steve becomes involved with Mike Wheeler
      and his friends after Dustin asks him to help find his "pet" D'Artagnan,
      unaware it is a Demodog. Steve and Dustin bond over how to talk to girls,
      and soon Steve also takes Mike, Lucas, and Max (Billy's step-sister) under
      his wing. Steve protects the children as Demodogs start ravaging across
      Hawkins, giving time for Eleven and Jim Hopper to close the gate to the
      Upside Down, and for Will Byers to have the Mind Flayer exorcised from his
      body. He also defends the kids against Billy, and is knocked unconscious
      before Max is able to disable her brother.
